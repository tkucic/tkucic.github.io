## Featured portfolio projects

### QueueLib

This repo is a collection of all kinds of Queue function blocks. It is primarily used for educational purposes. The library is meant for Codesys V3 and its derivative IDEs for use in PLC programming. Function blocks are developed using OOIP using only methods.

Types of Queues:

- Standard Queue
- Circular Queue
- First word fall trough Queue
- Unordered Queue
- Ordered Queue
- Stack

### ModbusXml

![ModbusXml](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/modbusXml/master/img/screenshot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

These programs use pyModbus package to implement a Modbus client class, GUI for that client and a server. Configuration of client and the server can be done from the register and device configuration xml. The user of the program just needs to modify the xml file and run the server and GUI.

### UniTest (Universal PLC Unit Test library)

![UniTest](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/UniTest/main/logo.png){:class="img-responsive"}

UniTest is a PLC, IDE and manufacturer agnostic library written using only the features of the IEC61131 standard. Due to this, portability to all IEC compliant platforms is straightforward and can be achieved programmatically or with minimal manual work.

### OSCAT LIB PORT FOR B&R AUTOMATION STUDIO

![BR_OSCAT_LIB](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/brOscatLib/main/logo.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This repo is a port of the popular Oscat lib to the B&R Automation studio platform. The library contains all functions and function blocks that are in OscatBasic 3.34, Oscat building 1.00 and the Oscat network 1.35.2 library. At the moment, the libraries are a work in progress, the main programmatic porting has been going well. Depending on the amount of contributors the library will be ported to completion. Initial port was done from Codesys plc open xml export.

### PLC GARDEN CONTROLLER

![GARDEN_CTRL](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller/master/screenshot.gif){:class="img-responsive"}

Automated gardening at its best. This is a portfolio project that features a simulator and a controller of four gardens holding 25 flowers/plants each. Each garden has a watering platform system moved by servo motors. In this project the user can learn how to control servo motors, optimize instruction/path algorithms and generally learn how to program PLCs.

You can try and make your own watering algorithm that will keep ALL of the flowers alive. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller)

### PLC TRAFFIC CONTROL

![TRAFFIC_CTRL](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control/master/screenshot.gif){:class="img-responsive"}

Traffic control is often used a simple introduction into sequencing when programming PLCs. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple timing controller and a simulator for two crossroads that are one way streets with pedestrians going in all directions. The project is meant for beginners and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.

You are welcome to try to control it yourself! It is harder than it looks. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control)

### PLC HELLO MIXING TANK

![MIXING_TANK](https://raw.github.com/tkucic/plc_hello_mixing_tank/master/screenshot.gif){:class="img-responsive"}

In industrial automation the "hello world" program is a mixing tank. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple mixing tank controller and a simulator. The project is meant for beginners and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.
