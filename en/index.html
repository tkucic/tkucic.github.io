					<h3>MY STORY</h3>
					<hr>	
					<p>I was born 20.5.1989 in a small Croatian town of Rijeka. Rijeka is know for its open and international way of thinking, Ucka mountain, Tourism and the Croatias industry heart, the Shipyard 3.Maj. After electrical high school and university I decided to get experience from the maritime industry. In the three years that followed I moved from being a electrical cadet to electrotechnical officer. On 2016 I decided to return to a shore based job and the perfect place to improve and share my accuired skills was industrial automation.</p>
					<p>I strive to be better than the day before not only in my work but in personal life, sports and experience. Going forward is the only way I know. There is nothing better that I like than to solve an really complex problem, to be the guy who gets all things done. There is no problem that cannot be fixed. The only thing you have to do is look at it and the solution will pop into your head, eventually.</p>
					<p>I have also many hobbies for example: Travelling is the best way. Meeting new cultures and people opens your mind to new possibilities. Thats why I tend to travel as much as I can.See the map <a href="images/places.jpg">HERE<alt="places img"></a>.
					From cycling, running, gymnastics to the dynamic Street Workout, anything goes just to keep healthy and happy. More of that on the <a href=>Street Workout page</a> and <a href=http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_3NQEjUQSQi0PorU3TPVA>Youtube channel</a></p>

					<h4>Automated ships steam boiler</h4>
					<p>
						What is a steam boiler:
						Essentially, a boiler is a container into which water can be fed and by the application of heat is evaporated continuously into steam. Steam is raised mainly for heating the heavy fuel oil used to fire the ‘diesel engines’ , for space heating , to power cargo handling pumps and as an aid to cleaning storage tanks and surfaces.
						This program controls the ignition sequence of the burner in order to create steam. Along with the boiler program a simulator is included to simulate loads and to test the PID regulation.

						Showcase video (v2.0)
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ouNOCi6Tog&t=34s">Here</a>

						Goal of this program
						The idea behind of this project is to provide a support project for my bachelor degree paper "Automation of ships steam boiler". When the project is finished the bachelor degree will be accompanied by the complete PLC program and a simulator.

						Second intention of the project is to create a reference project that presents my automation skills and as such this project will never be really finished because there is always something to improve.
						The project can be downloaded from GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/tkucic/AutoSteamBoiler">here.</a>

					<h4>TKAutomationLib</h4>
					<p>
						Codesys library that supports various project of neighbour repositories Version: 1.0

						Contents of the library
						Pump control logic
						Pump model for simulation
						Tank control logic
						Tank model with several inputs for inflow and outflow
						Workplace with color changing functionality, tabs, navigation and status bar with automatic time reading
						How to use the library
						Control logic and simulation model objects:
						These objects are basically used by calling it using the Input Assistant in your project. Connect the variables to the IOs and compile the program to the PLC. For the visualisations drag and drop the corresponding control objects visualisation into your project and connect the correct variables to the control object.
						Model objects for simulation should be run on a separate PLC, OPC server or atleast separate PRG. Simulation communication should be done only by IOs.

						Workplace
						WorkplaceHandler function needs to be called in a PRG. Variable arrays need to be created and function block needs to be parametrized with project specific values. Visualization is of size 1980x1024 and should be drag and dropped to an empty visualisation. In the outputs of the WorkplaceHandler there is an array variable in which the first bit dictates which tab should be visible. All project visualisations should have that bit in its "Visible" parameter.
						Color can be set for the navigation bar, buttons and the status bar by entering hex code RGB when parametrizing WorkplaceHandler function in the format of 16#FFRRGGBB.
						
						The library is intended to be installed into the Codesys enviroment but it is protected from editing by a password. The library can be downloaded from GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/tkucic/tkautomation_lib">here.</a>

					<h4>PLC Programming school</h4>
					<p>
						Information about Structured Text programming is scarce to say the least so I have decided to solve this problem and dedicate a online school to teaching ST Code to anyone who wants to learn it.
						The school is in progress of being built as you are reading this text. It will focus on the IEC61311-3 standard and on Structured Text programming for PLCs. ST Code course will start as a introduction to what it really is and how to use it but after the introduction we will focuse on real life industry problems an we will solve them using structured text programming, functions, simulators and much more.
