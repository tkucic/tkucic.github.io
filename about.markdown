## HI, I AM TONI

"For me, what drives me, is all things electric and automated. I cannot imagine myself doing anything else."

I have been working as an Electro-technical officer onboard the largest container ships in the world where I learned how ship systems work in practice. That knowledge improved my automation designing and programming skills later on in my career.
Because of this I can provide unique experience from the operators and designers point of view, bridging the gap.

In recent years I have been working with Power control automation products, building them from the ground up or improving the maintenance processes of existing products using Scrum and Lean Six Sigma methodologies.

I am also a Python programmer so decision support with data analysis and automation assisted product development are my main points of interest.
